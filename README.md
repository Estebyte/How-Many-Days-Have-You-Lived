A program that calculate the days between 2 dates without using the datetime python library

The substraction algorithm, equals the birth date to the start of the next year, and the same with the current day, but to the start of it's year. It save the diferences in two variables whih will be added to the total. the algorithm doesn't count either the year of death nor the current year

then a for loop counts the days between this "new dates" and save it in a new variable.

the result is just the sum of the result of the loop, the dates left to end the birth year, and the days after the start of the current year.
